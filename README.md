A simple decentralized Ethereum betting application built for educational purposes on the Rinkeby Network.

## How it Works

1. Allows users to bet test Ether on a number from one to 10.
2. After 10 bets have been placed, the smart contract randomly selectes a winning number and deposits the balance of the contract into the winner(s) account(s). The terms of the contract are then reset.
3. If no winners have been selected, the balance carries over into drawing (similar to the lottery).
